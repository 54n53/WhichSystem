# WhichSystem

This script allows us to identify (give us a first idea of what we are up against) the operating system we are dealing with from the TTL with which the target responds when we ping it.

## TTL
Default values for different Operating systems:
| OS              | TTL |
|-----------------|-----|
| Windows 7,10,11 | 128 |
| Linux           |  64 |
| Mac OS          |  64 |
| Android         |  64 |
